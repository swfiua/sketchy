======================================
 Types, scope, languages and all that
======================================

I have been writing and reading python for a good while at this point,
20 years or so.

After a time, with a language, you learn idioms that allow you to do
more with less.

Lists and dictionaries, strings and sets.

The rest is just deciding how to name the keys, that get you to the
values, for each key.

So the problem turns into how to handle the keys and indices, the
meta-data, as man and machine try together to infer meaning.

Now we have learnt that our computers, lack an ounce of nuance, or if
they do and it works until it, rather spectacularly, doesn't.

So everything has types, as what could you possibly know, without types?

I have rarely known exactly what I might be passing around, but I can
fill in the details later, if it turns out I care enough, and the
language does not care.

But we can start by passing a *ball* around, and each have a turn to
see how it spins, or *quacks* if you like.

Handle what you can, raise *Exception* if you must, take a guess or go
random?

OK, that's the spec sorted.

Except I forgot about nesting and branching, can you add that to the spec?

Sooner or later you get interested in sound, language and images, or
stars, planets and galaxies, earth, atmosphere and seas?

Events and and who said what to who?

Pictures and postcards in semi-transparent post boxes.

But with images and waves, we have dictionaries and lists and the rest
is meta data.

News just in, there are pipelines and switches too.

You might need a *magic.Roundabout*.

How's it magic?

It knows nothing about what it its doing but switches stuff around
until the exceptions go away.

Time passes, then one day someone asks, how's it working?

Oh, its working just fine but it won't do anything useful with the
data yoy keep passing it.

How do you mean, won't do anything useful?

Well, whatever data you send, it just throws a few exceptions and
goes silent.

The developer swears it works, says go check the spec, it does exactly
what is asked, it isn't my fault you don't speak its language.
